## Features

- Multiple-choice questions
- Scenario-based questions
- Instant scoring and feedback
- Progress tracking during a session
- Simple, readable user interface

## Live Application

A hosted version of the application is available here:

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Python fundamentals and control flow
- Structured handling of question data
- Input validation and scoring logic
- Separation of concerns for maintainability
- Clear intent and documentation

## Scope and Limitations

Other professional and production systems are kept private due to
security, financial, and personal data sensitivity.
